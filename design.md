## 5. Core Features

### 5.1 Family Management

**Family Creation Flow:**

1. User registers and selects "Create Family" option
2. System generates unique family ID
3. Family Head enters family details (name, address, gotra)
4. Family Head receives family ID for sharing

**Member Joining Flow:**

1. Member receives family ID from Family Head
2. Member registers and enters family ID
3. Member completes profile (name, DOB, profession, location)
4. Family Head receives notification and approves member
5. Member gains access to family dashboard

**Member Invite & Approval (detailed)**

- When a user signs up and supplies a `familyId` (or unique family code), the system will create a pending `MemberInvite` record rather than immediately creating a `FamilyMember` entry.
- The `MemberInvite` stores: target `familyId`, `inviteEmail` (or invitedUserId when the user exists), `status` (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), optional `token`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, and review metadata (`reviewedBy`, `reviewedAt`, `remarks`).
- The Family Head (or authorized approver) is notified and can view pending invites on a dedicated invites UI. They can Approve or Reject each invite.
- On Approve: the backend creates the `FamilyMember` record (role MEMBER by default), sets the invite `status` to APPROVED, records `reviewedBy`/`reviewedAt`, and sends a notification to the new member.
- On Reject: the invite `status` becomes REJECTED and the requester is notified with any optional remarks.

Why this approach:

- Prevents unauthorized auto-joins and gives Family Heads control.
- Keeps membership history clean (invites separate from accepted FamilyMember rows).
- Supports invite-by-email scenarios (invite pre-registered or external emails).

API (examples):

- POST /api/signup/member — creates User and MemberInvite (status=PENDING) when `familyId` supplied.
- GET /api/families/:id/invites — family-head only: list pending invites.
- PATCH /api/families/:id/invites/:inviteId/approve — approve invite → create FamilyMember.
- PATCH /api/families/:id/invites/:inviteId/reject — reject invite.

**Features:**

- View family tree
- Track member status (alive/deceased)
- Update family information
- Export family data
- Privacy controls per member

5. Execute integration tests
6. Build Docker images
7. Push to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
8. Deploy to staging environment
9. Run smoke tests
10. Manual approval gate
11. Deploy to production
12. Health checks and monitoring

### 10.3 Monitoring & Alerting

**Metrics Tracked:**

- API response times
- Error rates
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates
- Server resource utilization
- User activity metrics

**Alerting Rules:**

- API error rate > 5%
- Response time > 2 seconds
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Disk space < 20%
- Memory utilization > 80%

**Tools:**
