### Recent Updates (Feb 5, 2026)

- ✅ **Redis caching for fan-out**: Implemented optional Redis-based caching in the fan-out path to reduce DB load during large broadcasts. When enabled (`NOTIFICATION_CACHE=true`) the fanout consumer/worker caches per-user notifications into Redis lists `notifications:{userId}` (RPUSH) with a TTL controlled by `NOTIFICATION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 7 days). The Kafka routing event is still emitted so channel workers continue to operate. A persistence/drain worker is recommended to reliably persist cached notifications to the DB.
- **Env vars introduced:** `NOTIFICATION_CACHE`, `REDIS_URL`, `NOTIFICATION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`.

## Update: Notifications UI, WebSocket tuning & Phone verification (Feb 7, 2026)

- **What we added today:** UX and runtime changes to make notifications composable, previewable, realtime-friendly, plus a lightweight phone verification API and UI.
  - Admin notification composer with **priority selector**, **channel chooser** (IN_APP / EMAIL / PUSH / SMS), **target role** selector, and **preview before send** (`apps/web/app/admin/notifications/page.tsx`).
  - Notifications listing page with **WebSocket live updates** so new notifications and updates appear without page refresh (`apps/web/app/notifications/page.tsx`).
  - Shared Redis client: backend services (WS subscriber, in-app worker, fanout worker path) now use a shared Redis client singleton to avoid connection churn and reduce latency (`apps/be/lib/redisClient.ts`).
  - Server-side preview dedupe: previews now include a stable `previewId` (uses Kafka `eventId` when available) and the backend sets a per-recipient preview marker `notification_preview:{userId}:{previewId}` with a short TTL (env `NOTIFICATION_PREVIEW_TTL_SECONDS`, default 60s). Persisted in-app publishes skip recipients who recently received a preview to avoid duplicates (`apps/be/routes/notifications.ts`, `apps/be/kafka/workers/in-app-worker.ts`).
  - WebSocket auth hardening: browser clients now perform an initial auth handshake message (`{type: 'auth', token}`) immediately after connecting; the server accepts unauthenticated upgrades but requires that message within 5s to register the socket. The `?token=` query param is deprecated and no longer accepted by `apps/ws/utils.ts`.
  - Phone verification: added `POST /api/phone/verify` for local format validation and a small interactive UI at `/phone/verify` that normalizes input to E.164 and persists the profile on success (`apps/be/routes/phone.ts`, `apps/web/app/phone/verify/page.tsx`).

- **Why this matters:**
  - Admins can craft richer notifications and preview them before broadcasting, reducing mistakes and enabling multi-channel targeting.
  - Users receive notifications in real-time, improving engagement and lowering poll/refresh load.
  - Shared Redis and server-side dedupe reduce duplicate deliveries and lower DB pressure during fan-outs.
  - WebSocket auth handshake avoids leaking tokens in URLs and improves security posture while keeping browser compatibility.

- **Follow-ups / TODOs created:**
  - Implement SMS OTP send/verify endpoints and UI (pluggable providers) — added to backlog as high-priority for phone ownership verification.
  - Implement persistence/drain worker to flush cached Redis notifications into the DB reliably (recommended when `NOTIFICATION_CACHE=true`).
  - Add server-side token revocation checks / blacklist during WS auth and rotate short-lived handshake tokens.

**Notes:** the phone verify API currently performs local validation (libphonenumber-js). For production ownership verification, implement SMS OTP or integrate a provider (Twilio Verify / MessageBird). The WebSocket `?token=` behavior has been removed; clients should perform the auth handshake or use HttpOnly cookies for upgrade authentication in production.

## Update: Feb 9, 2026

- ✅ **Block login for deceased/inactive users:** Auth handlers now prevent login when a user's `status` is `false` (deceased/inactive). Implemented in family-head, member, and admin auth routes (`apps/be/routes/auth/fh.ts`, `apps/be/routes/auth/fm.ts`, `apps/be/routes/auth/admin.ts`) and return `403` with a clear message.
- ✅ **Resource request approval emails:** When a `ResourceRequest` reaches `APPROVED`, the backend now creates the in-app notification (existing behavior) and also broadcasts an EMAIL notification event via Kafka so the email worker sends an approval email to the requester (`apps/be/routes/resourceReq.ts`, Kafka router -> `apps/be/kafka/workers/email.ts`).
- ✅ **Documentation:** Added a pre-implementation checklist for admin-controlled event visibility to the Event Management section (`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`).

## Update: Feb 10, 2026

- ✅ **Observability & Local Monitoring Stack:** Added a local monitoring stack and application instrumentation to improve visibility and debugging during development.
  - `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` — Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, Promtail provisioning and provisioning files added under `monitoring/`.
  - Prometheus config (`monitoring/prometheus.yml`) with `alert.rules.yml` to detect backend down, high error rate, and high p95 latency.
  - Alertmanager config (`monitoring/alertmanager.yml`) added with a placeholder PagerDuty receiver (`REPLACE_WITH_PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY`) for easy integration.
  - Grafana provisioning: datasources for Prometheus and Loki plus multiple pre-provisioned dashboards:
    - `request-duration` (p95 histogram)
    - `errors-and-rps` (error rate + request rate)
    - `logs-overview` (Loki-based recent error logs)
    - `backend-overview`, `latency-percentiles`, `top-endpoints` (richer metrics views)
  - Promtail config (`monitoring/promtail-config.yml`) added to push container logs to Loki (note: path may need adjustment on macOS).

- ✅ **Backend instrumentation & logging:** Improved app observability without changing runtime behavior.
  - Added `prom-client` and `winston` to `apps/be/package.json`.
  - `apps/be/lib/metrics.ts` — collects default metrics, exposes `http_request_duration_seconds` histogram, `http_requests_total` counter, and `errors_total` counter; `metricsHandler()` returns Prometheus text format.
  - `apps/be/lib/logger.ts` — simple `winston` logger used by the backend.
  - `/metrics` endpoint exposed in `apps/be/server/staticRoutes.ts` and metrics initialization wired in `apps/be/index.ts`.

- ✅ **Developer ergonomics & compose fixes:**
  - Adjusted `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` to map Grafana to host port `3005` (avoids conflict with frontend on `3000`).
  - Fixed `docker-compose.kafka.yml`: removed host binding for `9093` (conflicted with Alertmanager), removed obsolete `version` key, and corrected a duplicate `services:` line introduced during edits.
  - Verified local start: zookeeper, kafka, redis started; redis logs validated.

- ⚠️ **Notes & Next Steps:**
  - Router-level instrumentation (middleware to label `route`, `status`, and `method` for each request) is recommended to capture meaningful per-endpoint metrics; I can implement this next in `apps/be/server/router.ts`.
  - If you want New Relic integration, the recommended immediate step is to enable Prometheus `remote_write` to New Relic (no app changes). Full APM (traces) requires the New Relic Node agent and running the backend on Node (Bun compatibility is not guaranteed).
  - Replace the PagerDuty placeholder in `monitoring/alertmanager.yml` with your integration key and restart Alertmanager to enable notifications.


Notes:
- Email delivery uses the existing Kafka notification pipeline; ensure SMTP env vars (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SENDER_EMAIL`) are set in staging/production for real delivery.
- Recommend adding unit/integration tests for auth blocking and notification enqueueing as a follow-up.

## Update 13 Mar
jwt didn't had refresh token, implemented refresh token hence now the auth shouldn't auto sign-out now
fixed run time errors in react components
downgrade to prisma6 for successful build
Audited and fixed login flow: ensured frontend sends role in uppercase to match backend.
Reviewed schema and seed data for user/role consistency.
Added frontend logic for silent refresh token handling—auto-renews access token on expiry.
fixed builds
